<h2>🛢️ Set Up Database</h2>
<p>This project uses Firebase, but the current Firebase account has been disabled due to spamming, so the app won’t work. To make it functional, create a new Firebase project, add the Android app, and generate the google-services.json file. Place it in the app/ directory. Then, enable Email Authentication, Realtime Database, and Cloud Storage in your Firebase project.</p>
